\paragraph{Suggestion:}
To make version control more easy, try to put each sentence on a single line.
Use your text editors wrapping option to wrap long sentences (i.e. lines) at the window borders.

\paragraph{Suggestion:}
You may optionally end each chapter by a \verb+\cleardoublepage+ command.
This flushes all floating objects (figures, tables, etc.) and makes chapters start on right pages in twoside mode.
You can safely use \verb+\cleardoublepage+ also in single sided printing, it behaves the same as \verb+\clearpage+.
